# 🌦 Weather Forecast App (Python + Tkinter)

This is a simple **Weather Forecast desktop application** built by me using **Python** in my 1st semester.  
It uses **Tkinter** for the GUI and **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch real-time weather information.
The real-time weather information of any place across the world can be known using this application.

## 🚀 Features
- Clean and simple GUI  
- Takes a place/city name as input  
- Shows:
  - Temperature (°C)  
  - Weather description  
  - Humidity (%)  
  - Wind speed  
- Error messages for invalid inputs or network issues

## 🧠 Idea Behind This Project
I made this project to learn:
- How APIs work  
- How to build GUI apps using Tkinter  
- How to handle JSON data from an API  

This was one of my first hands-on Python projects.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (GUI)
- **Requests** library (API calls)
- **OpenWeatherMap API**

## 🌐 About the OpenWeatherMap API
I used the **Current Weather Data API** from OpenWeatherMap.

### API URL:
https://openweathermap.org/api


### What parameters I sent:
- `q` → place/city name  
- `appid` → my API key  
- `units=metric` → to get temperature in Celsius  

You can get your own API key by creating a free account at:  
https://openweathermap.org/api

The weather app window will open.

## 📌 Future Improvements (optional)
- Better UI  
- Weather icons  
- Auto-detect location  
- 5-day forecast
